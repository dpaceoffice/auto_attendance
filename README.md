This script is designed to automatically take roll on moodle for software engineering, and start zoom after. 

The configuations must be set or adjusted to your system to properly work. I.E timeout may need to be extended for slower internet, or lowered for faster internet.
The email and password must be defined, and 
the driver must also be set to use the broswer installed on your system. 

This script has yet to go through rigourus testing so if any bugs may be encounted please report those here.
Discovered bugs will be corrected accordingly, so it may be in a person's interest to clone this repository to 
automatically have any adjustments.
